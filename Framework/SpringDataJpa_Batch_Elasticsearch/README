Before start-up
===============
It should have Customer table in mysql if not application can't start-up resulting with [Table 'test.customer' doesn't exist].
If another table data to be transfered need to change the domain wherever it has been mentioned.
RowMapper in batch should have field name mentioned in customer table else throws Unknown column 'lastName' in 'field list'
